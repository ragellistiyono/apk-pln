# Tasks: Internal Ticket Management System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ticket-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete and clarified)

**Tests**: Tests are included as this is a production system requiring quality assurance.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (Setup, Foundation, US1, US2, US3, US4, US5, US6)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Flutter app**: `lib/` in current workspace (`/home/ragel/Documents/projek-it-pln-ktg/apk_pln`)
- **Backend API**: Separate repository (recommend creating `backend/` or separate repo)
- All paths assume Flutter project structure from plan.md

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1, US2, US3 are P1 and should be completed together (core MVP)
  - US4, US5 are P2 and can be done after MVP is working
  - US6 is P3 and can be done last
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Should integrate with US1 for complete workflow
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Enhances US1 and US2 with communication
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1-3
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Should wait until US1-3 are stable (needs tickets to notify about)
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Should wait until system has historical data to analyze

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Backend API endpoints before Flutter integration
- Models and repositories before BLoCs
- BLoCs before UI screens
- Core screens before polish widgets
- Story complete and tested before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- Backend and Flutter setup can happen simultaneously (Phase 1)
- Within Foundational phase: database migrations, models, and client setup can be parallel
- Once Foundational complete: US1, US2, US3 can be developed in parallel by different developers
- Widget development can happen while API development is ongoing (with mocked data)
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Employee creates tickets)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Technician resolves tickets)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Comment system)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test complete ticket workflow end-to-end
7. Deploy/demo MVP

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Stories 1-3 ‚Üí Test thoroughly ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! üéØ)
3. Add User Story 4 (Admin) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 5 (Notifications) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 6 (Reporting) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Polish phase ‚Üí Final release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Employee features)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Technician features)
   - Developer C: Backend API + User Story 3 (Comments)
3. Stories complete and integrate for MVP demo
4. Then parallelize US4, US5, US6 as desired

## Constitution Compliance Checklist

Before completing implementation, verify adherence to constitution principles:

- [ ] **File Size**: All modified files remain under 700 lines (target 500) - run analysis before merge
- [ ] **Testing**: Appropriate tests written and passing (unit: 43 tests minimum, widget: 15+, integration: 5+)
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Code is modular, documented with doc comments, and follows single responsibility
- [ ] **UX Consistency**: UI follows Material Design 3 and maintains consistent spacing/typography/colors
- [ ] **Performance**: No performance regressions; maintains 60 FPS; list scrolling smooth with 100+ items
- [ ] **Conventions**: Follows Flutter/Dart naming conventions (snake_case files, PascalCase classes, lowerCamelCase variables)
- [ ] **Dependencies**: No circular dependencies; proper resource disposal (controllers, streams, WebSocket)
- [ ] **Offline Support**: Offline mode tested and working correctly
- [ ] **Real-time**: Comments and notifications deliver within 5 seconds
- [ ] **Time Tracking**: Time elapsed displays update correctly every minute

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US6, Setup, Foundation)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests written FIRST, verify they fail, then implement to make them pass
- Commit after each task or logical group (aim for small, focused commits)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Backend and Flutter can be developed in parallel with clear API contracts
- File size limit (700 lines) will be enforced - extract widgets/services if approaching limit
- Keep tasks focused and specific - if task description is vague, break it down further
- Use mocking for tests to avoid external dependencies
- Follow TDD discipline: Red (test fails) ‚Üí Green (test passes) ‚Üí Refactor (improve code)

## Task Count Summary

- **Setup**: 10 tasks
- **Foundation**: 32 tasks (16 backend, 16 Flutter)
- **User Story 1**: 21 tasks (5 tests, 4 backend, 12 Flutter)
- **User Story 2**: 13 tasks (3 tests, 3 backend, 7 Flutter)
- **User Story 3**: 15 tasks (3 tests, 3 backend, 9 Flutter)
- **User Story 4**: 10 tasks (2 tests, 3 backend, 5 Flutter)
- **User Story 5**: 13 tasks (2 tests, 4 backend, 7 Flutter)
- **User Story 6**: 6 tasks (3 backend, 3 Flutter)
- **Polish**: 20 tasks

**Total**: 140 tasks

**Estimated Effort**: 
- MVP (Setup + Foundation + US1-3): ~70 tasks = 4-6 weeks with 2-3 developers
- Full system: 140 tasks = 8-10 weeks with 2-3 developers
