# Feature Specification: Internal Ticket Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-ticket-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Clarified - Ready for Planning
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-19 (Clarification Complete)
**Input**: User description: "Buat aplikasi untuk mengelola sistem tiket internal perusahaan dengan tiga peran pengguna: Employee (pelapor), Technician (penyelesai), dan Admin (pengelola)."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Employee Creates and Tracks Ticket (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

An employee encounters a technical problem and needs to report it to the appropriate technician for resolution.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - employees must be able to report issues and get them resolved. Without this, the system has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Employee can create a ticket, select appropriate technician, and receive updates on ticket status without any other user stories being implemented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** employee has logged in with username (NIP), **When** they create a new ticket describing a hardware issue in their region, **Then** system shows matching technicians from their region who handle hardware issues
2. **Given** employee has submitted a ticket, **When** technician accepts the ticket, **Then** employee receives notification that their ticket is being worked on
3. **Given** technician completes the ticket, **When** they mark it as resolved with notes, **Then** employee receives notification with resolution details
4. **Given** employee has multiple tickets, **When** they view their ticket list, **Then** they can see status of all tickets (pending, in-progress, completed) with latest updates and comment counts
5. **Given** employee needs to provide additional information, **When** they add a comment to their ticket, **Then** technician receives notification and can view the comment in conversation thread

---

### User Story 2 - Technician Receives and Resolves Tickets (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

A technician receives ticket assignments matching their expertise and region, works on them, and marks them as complete.

**Why this priority**: Equally critical as employee ticket creation - technicians need to receive, acknowledge, and resolve tickets. These two stories form the minimum viable ticket system.

**Independent Test**: Technician can log in, see assigned tickets, accept them, and mark them complete independently of admin features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** employee creates ticket matching technician's category and region, **When** system assigns ticket, **Then** technician receives in-app notification with ticket details
2. **Given** technician receives new ticket, **When** they accept/acknowledge it, **Then** system updates ticket status to "in-progress" and notifies employee
3. **Given** technician has resolved the issue, **When** they mark ticket as complete with resolution notes, **Then** system updates status to "completed" and notifies employee
4. **Given** technician views their dashboard, **When** they check their queue, **Then** they see all pending and in-progress tickets assigned to them with time elapsed indicators
5. **Given** technician needs clarification on an issue, **When** they add a comment asking questions, **Then** employee receives notification and can respond with additional details

---

### User Story 3 - Technician Matching Based on Category, Sub-Category, and Region (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

System intelligently matches tickets to appropriate technicians based on problem category, sub-category, and employee's region.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for the system to function properly - tickets must go to the right technician. Without proper matching, the system creates chaos.

**Independent Test**: Create tickets with different combinations of category/sub-category/region and verify correct technicians are matched in each case.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** employee in UPT Malang reports hardware issue, **When** they search for technicians, **Then** system shows Parluhutan Harahap (regional) and any "ALL UIT" technicians
2. **Given** employee reports VPN issue (Akun category, VPN sub-category), **When** system matches technician, **Then** Risma Budi is selected regardless of region
3. **Given** employee reports Smartness application issue, **When** system matches technician, **Then** Hartanto Budi is selected (application-specific, no region limit)
4. **Given** employee in Kantor Induk reports SAP issue, **When** they filter technicians, **Then** system shows Pupus Dwi Anggono (regional) and Alfian Prasetyo (ALL UIT with SAP expertise)

---

### User Story 4 - Admin Manages System Data (Priority: P2)

Admin can create, read, update, and delete employee and technician data to maintain accurate system information.

**Why this priority**: Important for long-term maintenance but not critical for initial ticket flow. System can function with pre-populated data initially.

**Independent Test**: Admin can log in and perform CRUD operations on both employees and technicians without affecting ticket flow (tickets continue working with existing data).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin is logged in, **When** new employee joins company, **Then** admin can create employee record with NIP and name
2. **Given** technician changes region or specialization, **When** admin updates technician profile, **Then** future ticket matching reflects the updated information
3. **Given** employee leaves company, **When** admin deactivates/deletes their account, **Then** their historical tickets remain visible but they cannot create new tickets
4. **Given** admin views technician list, **When** they search by region or category, **Then** system filters and displays matching technicians

---

### User Story 5 - Notification System (Priority: P2)

Users receive timely in-app notifications about ticket status changes relevant to their role.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience but tickets can still be tracked manually. Push notifications improve responsiveness but aren't blocking for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Create ticket workflow (create â†’ accept â†’ complete) and verify notifications appear at each stage for relevant users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** ticket is created, **When** system assigns to technician, **Then** technician receives notification within 5 seconds
2. **Given** technician accepts ticket, **When** status changes to in-progress, **Then** employee receives notification within 5 seconds
3. **Given** technician completes ticket, **When** they add resolution notes, **Then** employee receives notification with notes visible
4. **Given** comment is added to ticket, **When** other party opens app, **Then** they receive notification of new comment within 5 seconds
5. **Given** user has unread notifications, **When** they open app, **Then** notification badge displays count and notifications are marked as read when viewed

---

### User Story 6 - Ticket History and Reporting (Priority: P3)

Users can view historical ticket data and generate reports for analysis.

**Why this priority**: Valuable for analytics and improvement but not essential for day-to-day operations. Can be added after core system is stable.

**Independent Test**: Create and complete multiple tickets, then verify history is searchable and reports can be generated independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** employee has 50 completed tickets, **When** they search their history, **Then** they can filter by date range, category, and status
2. **Given** technician wants to review their work, **When** they view statistics, **Then** they see total tickets completed, average resolution time, and breakdown by category
3. **Given** admin needs monthly report, **When** they generate report, **Then** system exports data showing total tickets, completion rates, and technician performance metrics

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no technician matches the exact combination of category, sub-category, and region?
  - System suggests closest matches (e.g., same category but ALL UIT region)
  - Allow employee to manually select from broader list if no exact match

- How does system handle if technician is unavailable/on leave?
  - Admin can mark technicians as temporarily unavailable
  - System skips unavailable technicians in matching algorithm
  - **Note**: Since reassignment not allowed, employee must choose available technician carefully

- What if employee creates duplicate tickets for same issue?
  - System detects similar recent tickets (same category, similar description) and warns employee
  - Allow employee to proceed if genuinely different issue

- How are ticket priorities determined?
  - MVP: All tickets treated equally, displayed by creation time (oldest first)
  - Time elapsed displayed to show urgency
  - Future enhancement: allow explicit priority levels

- What happens if wrong technician is selected?
  - **Clarified**: Tickets CANNOT be reassigned in MVP
  - Employee and technician can communicate via comments to clarify
  - If truly wrong assignment, ticket must be marked complete by current technician and employee creates new ticket
  - Future enhancement: Allow admin reassignment

- How to handle tickets that need multiple technicians?
  - MVP: One technician per ticket
  - Technician can add comments suggesting colleague involvement (communication outside system)
  - Future enhancement: Allow collaborative/shared tickets

- What if employee or technician deletes comments by mistake?
  - MVP: Comments cannot be deleted, only added (prevents loss of information)
  - Future enhancement: Allow edit/delete with history tracking

- How is offline comment sync handled?
  - Comments created offline are queued locally
  - When connection restored, comments sync in chronological order
  - System prevents duplicate comments with unique client-side IDs

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Use BLoC or Provider for managing: authentication state, ticket lists, notification state, comment threads
- Separate state management for each major feature (auth, tickets, notifications, comments, admin)

### Data Persistence & Backend
- **Backend**: Self-hosted REST API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Local Cache**: SQLite/Hive for offline capability and caching
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or polling for comment threads and notifications
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication with refresh tokens

### API Endpoints (Preliminary)
```
POST   /api/auth/login          - Authenticate user, return JWT
POST   /api/auth/refresh        - Refresh JWT token
GET    /api/tickets             - List tickets (filtered by role)
POST   /api/tickets             - Create new ticket
GET    /api/tickets/:id         - Get ticket details with comments
POST   /api/tickets/:id/accept  - Technician accepts ticket
POST   /api/tickets/:id/complete - Technician completes ticket
POST   /api/tickets/:id/comments - Add comment to ticket
GET    /api/technicians         - List technicians (for matching)
GET    /api/notifications       - Get user notifications
```

### Technician Matching Algorithm
```
Priority order for matching:
1. Exact match: category + sub-category + region
2. Category + sub-category + ALL UIT
3. Category + region (if sub-category not critical)
4. Category + ALL UIT
5. Manual selection fallback
```

### Notification Strategy
- In-app notifications for: new ticket assignment, ticket status changes, new comments
- WebSocket or polling for real-time notification delivery
- Badge counts on app icon for unread notifications
- Notification types: ticket_assigned, ticket_accepted, ticket_completed, new_comment
- Future: Push notifications via FCM for critical updates when app in background

### Comment System Strategy
- Real-time or near-real-time updates via WebSocket/polling
- Comments stored in order with timestamps
- Display format: conversation thread (like WhatsApp/Slack)
- Show commenter role (Employee/Technician) and timestamp
- Mark unread comments with indicator

### Offline Support
- Queue ticket creation, comments, and status updates locally
- Sync when connection restored in chronological order
- Show clear offline indicator to user
- Prevent conflicts with optimistic updates and client-generated UUIDs
- Display warning if attempting actions requiring immediate confirmation (like ticket completion)
